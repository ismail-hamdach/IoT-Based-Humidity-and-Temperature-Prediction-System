## IoT-Based Humidity and Temperature Prediction System with Raspberry Pi, DHT22, MySQL, Python, and Node.js

**Description:**

Our innovative project combines the power of Internet of Things (IoT) with data science to create a robust Humidity and Temperature Prediction System. Using a Raspberry Pi with a DHT22 sensor, we collect real-time environmental data, storing it in a MySQL database. The seamless integration of Python scripts facilitates data transmission, while Node.js is employed to retrieve and showcase this valuable information on a dynamic HTML page.

### Key Components:

1. **Data Collection with Raspberry Pi and DHT22:**
   - The Raspberry Pi, paired with a DHT22 sensor, serves as our data collection hub, ensuring precision in measuring humidity and temperature.

2. **Data Storage in MySQL:**
   - MySQL acts as the backbone for secure data storage, enabling efficient organization and retrieval of real-time and historical data.

3. **Data Transmission with Python:**
   - Python scripts orchestrate the seamless transmission of real-time data, maintaining a constant flow from the Raspberry Pi to the MySQL database.

4. **Web Application with Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JS:**
   - Node.js takes the lead in constructing robust endpoints that facilitate seamless communication between the backend and our dynamic web application. The frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and JS, provides users with an engaging interface to access collected data.

5. **Predictive Modeling with Python:**
   - Leveraging the MySQL-stored data, Python scripts delve into predictive modeling, offering insights into future humidity and temperature trends.

### Technologies Used:

- **Raspberry Pi with DHT22:**
  - The Raspberry Pi ensures precise data collection through the DHT22 sensor.

- **MySQL:**
  - MySQL, a reliable and scalable database management system, facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of environmental data.

- **Python:**
  - Python scripts handle real-time data transmission and predictive modeling, enhancing the system's capabilities.

- **Node.js, HTML, CSS, JS:**
  - Node.js constructs robust endpoints to facilitate seamless communication, while the web application's frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) provides an engaging interface for users.

## Note
- Each application has its own documentation.
- Adjust .env and env.js files to match environment variables required.
